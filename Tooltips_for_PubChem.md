# MolGenie Organic Chemistry Ontology - Tooltips for PubChem

## MolGenie Organic Chemistry Ontology on prod
An organic chemistry ontology developed by MolGenie and OntoChem to assign compounds to structural classes, currently mapped to >1.7 million per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from the datasets explained in Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A

## MolGenie Organic Chemistry Ontology on test
An organic chemistry ontology developed by MolGenie and OntoChem to assign chemical entities to structural classes, split into three main subsections: calculated properties, compounds and substructural concepts. The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.
