# MolGenie Organic Chemistry Ontology
This repository hosts the [MolGenie](https://molgenie.com/) Organic Chemistry Ontology (MOCO for short). 
This is an ontology developed by MolGenie and [OntoChem](https://ontochem.com/) to assign compounds to structural classes,
focusing primarily on organic chemistry. A separate Inorganic Chemistry Ontology (MICO) will be developed. 
The main contact person for MOCO is Lutz Weber ([lutzweber](https://github.com/lutzweber)). 

## The MolGenie Organic Chemistry Ontology (MOCO) in PubChem
A draft version of the MolGenie Organic Chemistry Ontology is currently available on the 
[PubChem Classification Browser](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/classification/#hid=134) 
and linked to the [MolGenie Data Source](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/source/27441). 
The public version is mapped up to the 1.7 million per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) 
that were extracted as part of PFAS Set A as described in Barnabas _et al._ (2022) _Digital Discovery_ 
DOI: [10.1039/D2DD00019A](https://doi.org/10.1039/D2DD00019A).

An updated version is being developed that maps to several datasets, including:

- The Chemicals of Biological Interest ([ChEBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/)) collection: ~175K chemical entities;
- The [ChEMBL](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/) database of bioactive molecules with drug-like properties: ~2.4M chemical entities;
- The [LOTUS](https://lotus.naturalproducts.net/) collection of natural products: ~210K chemical entities;
- The PFAS collection described in Barnabas _et al._ (2022) DOI: [10.1039/D2DD00019A](https://doi.org/10.1039/D2DD00019A): ~1.8M chemical entities;
- The [ZeroPM](https://database.zeropm.eu/) Global Chemical Inventory (GCI) collection: ~180K chemical entities;
- The November 2024 version of [PubChemLite](https://pubchemlite.lcsb.uni.lu/): ~400K chemical entities.
