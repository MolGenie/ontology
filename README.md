# MolGenie Organic Chemistry Ontology
This repository hosts the [MolGenie](https://molgenie.com/) Organic Chemistry Ontology (MOCO for short). 
This is an ontology developed by MolGenie and [OntoChem](https://ontochem.com/) to assign compounds to structural classes,
focusing primarily on organic chemistry. A separate Inorganic Chemistry Ontology (MICO) will be developed. 
The main contact person for MOCO is Lutz Weber ([lutzweber](https://github.com/lutzweber)). 

## The MolGenie Organic Chemistry Ontology (MOCO) in PubChem
A version of MOCO is currently under development on the 
[PubChem Classification Browser](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/classification/#hid=72) 
and will be linked to the [MolGenie Data Source](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/source/27441) once public. 
At this stage, MOCO is mapped up to the 1.7 million per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) 
that were extracted as part of PFAS Set A as described in Barnabas _et al._ (2022) _Digital Discovery_ 
DOI: [10.1039/D2DD00019A](https://doi.org/10.1039/D2DD00019A).
